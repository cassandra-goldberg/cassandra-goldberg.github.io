Hello! My name is Cassandra (Casey) Goldberg. I am a first-year computer science PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania. I am a part of the[Brachio Lab](https://brachiolab.github.io/), which is advised by [Eric Wong](https://riceric22.github.io/). 

I previously earned my BA in computer science and physics at Bowdoin College. There, I researched statistically-sound deep learning techniques for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image segmentation under the mentorship of [Jeov√° Farias](https://jeovafarias.github.io/). 

Going forward, I am interested in researching trustworthy and responsible AI.
