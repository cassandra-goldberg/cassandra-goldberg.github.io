Hello! My name is Cassandra (Casey) Goldberg. I am a first-year computer science PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania advised by [Eric Wong](https://riceric22.github.io/). During my undergrad at Bowdoin College, I researched statistically-sound deep learning techniques for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image segmentation under the mentorship of Jeov√° Farias. Going forward, I am interested in researching trustworthy and responsible AI.
