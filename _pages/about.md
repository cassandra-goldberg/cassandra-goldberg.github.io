Hello! My name is Cassandra (Casey) Goldberg. I am a first-year computer science PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania. I am fortunate to be advised by [Eric Wong](https://riceric22.github.io/), where I work as part of his [Brachio Lab](https://brachiolab.github.io/). 

I previously earned my BA in computer science and physics at Bowdoin College. There, I researched statistically-sound deep learning techniques for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image segmentation under the mentorship of [Jeov√° Farias](https://jeovafarias.github.io/). 

Going forward, I am interested in researching trustworthy and responsible AI. 

## Recent News!
- **May 22, 2024**: I completed my senior Honors Project, 'Statistically Principled Deep Learning for SAR Image Segmentation,' which can be found in [Bowdoin Digital Archives](https://digitalcommons.bowdoin.edu/honorsprojects/517/).
- **Feb 27, 2024**: I was honored to be chosen as an AAAI-24 Undergraduate 
Consortium Scholar, where I had the opportunity to attend the conference and present a 
project proposal which is published in their [Conference Proceedings](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/issue/view/596).
